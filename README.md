# banking-system
This project is a simple banking system implemented using core Java. It allows users (customers) to create accounts, deposit money, withdraw funds, and transfer money between accounts. The system is built using object-oriented principles (OOP) and demonstrates the use of basic Java constructs like classes, collections, and exception handling.
